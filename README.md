- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @DocDingle
- ðŸ‘€ I study systems of humans and systems of technology, continually seeking to find and create ways to make them work better, together. I have a Ph.D. in Computer Science and a Master's in Mathematics from Texas A&M University. I have been working in Graphics, Advanced Visualization, Modeling, Simulation, and Analysis for over 20 years. For a brief while I worked in Game Design and Development, with two published titles. I was also an Assistant Professor at the University of Wisconsin-Stout. My current work efforts include investigations into extended reality, AI/ML, reality capture, remote sensors, and mechatronics.
- I have a strong interest in understanding and exploring all aspects of Perception and Reality, including the interaction and Visualization thereof. I believe technology influences our understanding and perception. It enables us to learn, do, and become more. Creation of technology requires exploration of abstractions. Providing new ways to explore and experience such abstractions can advance, or hinder, our abilities and understanding. Knowing how and why is important and can be applied in many different business environments, industrial or academic, theoretically or applied. I have experience in a wide range of areas, with notable success in all.
- ðŸ“« For now, to reach me, you should already know me.
